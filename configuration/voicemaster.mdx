<Info>Server prefix is set to `;` by default. Use `;prefix [symbol]` to change it for your server.</Info>

## Overview & Setup:

To setup voicemaster, you need to run the following command:

```py
;voicemaster setup
```

This will create an interface channel and a voice channel used to create a channel for the user.

These two channels are needed for the voicemaster module to work. Joining the join to create voice channel will create a voice channel in which that user owns and can control.
