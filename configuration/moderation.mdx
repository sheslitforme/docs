<Info>Server prefix is set to `;` by default. Use `;prefix [symbol]` to change it for your server.</Info>

## Overview & Setup:

To setup moderation, you need to run the following command:

```py
;setmod
```

## Explanation:

Setting this up creates a jail channel, modlog channel and a jail role. The jailed channel cannot be accessed by anyone unless they have administrator permissions. You can override this in channel settings.

This role should never be added manually, this should only be applied to jailed members. These additions can be utilized by using the ``;jail`` command. Using this command will remove all roles from a member (that the bot can manage) and add the jailed role to them. Doing this will only allow them to see the jailed channel.

<Info>Category overrides will be created for every category denying the View Channel permission for the jailed role. This is essential for the jail module to function correctly..</Info>

Run ``;unjail`` to unjail a jailed member.
