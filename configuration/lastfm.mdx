<Info>Server prefix is set to `;` by default. Use `;prefix [symbol]` to change it for your server.</Info>

## Setup:

Last.fm is a way to show what you're listening to. Make sure you have a Last.fm account. If you don't, [go here](https://last.fm/join).

Run the following command:

```py
;lastfm login
```

## Logging in:

<img height="200" src="/images/lastfm/HMri8U.png" />

Evict will DM you asking you to authorize your account with Last.fm, click on the link, login to your Last.fm account and authorize the application.
Once this is done, you should see the following message:

<img height="200" src="/images/lastfm/tg12pm.png" />

## Unlink the account:
To remove your last.fm account from the bot, simply run ``;lastfm remove``. All of your Last.fm data will be removed from the Evict's database.

## What now?
That's all to it! Run the ``;fm`` or ``;nowplaying`` command to share what you're listening to. This works by taking the music statistics from your Last.fm account. You can connect your Spotify account and start scrobbling from there by [going here](https://last.fm/settings/applications).

<Info>If this command does not show the correct song, either your Last.fm library is not updated or you are not currently scrobbling anything.</Info>

## Errors:
Most last.fm errors come from the Last.fm API being broken. We have **no control** over these errors, you would have to wait for Last.fm to fix it. If you encounter another error, please let us know in our [support server](https://discord.gg/evict).


Removing your Last.fm account from Evict and readding it **does not** fix this.
