<Info>Server prefix is set to `;` by default. Use `;prefix [symbol]` to change it for your server.</Info>

## Setup:

Last.fm is a way to show what you're listening to. Make sure you have a last.fm account. If you don't, [go here](https://last.fm/join).

Run the following command:

```py
;lastfm set [username]
```

## Logging in:

<img height="200" src="/images/lastfm/gS6Mre.png" />

Once that is done, Evict will connect to your LastFM account.

## This account doesn't exist:

If you get this message, the specified last.fm account does not exist. Are there spelling mistakes in your username? Did you create your last.fm account?

## Unlink the account:
To remove your last.fm account from the bot, simply run ``;lastfm remove``. All of your last.fm data will be removed from the Evict's database.

## What now?
That's all to it! Run the ``;fm`` or ``;nowplaying`` command to share what you're listening to. This works by taking the music statistics from your Last.fm account. You can connect your Spotify account and start scrobbling from there by [going here](https://last.fm/settings/applications).

<Info>If this command does not show the correct song, either your last.fm library is not updated or you are not currently scrobbling anything.</Info>

## Errors:
Most last.fm errors come from the Last.fm API being broken. We have **no control** over these errors, you would have to wait for Last.fm to fix it. If you encounter another error, please let us know in our [support server](https://discord.gg/evict).
