## Enabling reskin

<img height="200" src="/images/reskin/nXxTkK.png" />
Run ``reskin enable`` to enable reskin. Evict will create a webhook and send the output using your username and avatar.
Reskin breaks some functionality of the bot like editing message outputs as well as message deletions. This will be slowly fixed 
in the future but it's something to keep in mind.

### Changing The avatar using a file

<img height="200" src="/images/reskin/G33RPV.png" />
Run ``reskin avatar [file here]`` to change the avatar. Evict will now use the file provided as the avatar.

### Changing The avatar using a link

<img height="200" src="/images/reskin/g2DqEw.png" />
Run ``reskin avatar [link here]`` to change the avatar. Evict will now use the file link provided as the avatar. If you use a link be sure it is a permanent one,
it will break command outputs if not.

### Disabling Reskin

<img height="200" src="/images/reskin/8N3lWj.png" />
Run ``reskin disable`` to disable reskin. Command output will now use default.
